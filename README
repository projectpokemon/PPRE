Project Pokemon ROM Editor 2 (PPRE)
URL: http://projectpokemon.org/ppre/
Author: Alpha

PPRE is a multi-purpose ROM editing tool for altering Nintendo DS Pokemon games.
The project was started originally to edit Pokemon Diamond and Pearl by SCV
based off of Treeki's Nitro Explorer and loadingNOW's thenewpoketext. pichu2000 
created a strong basis for the scripting capabilities that PPRE will always 
have. Alpha has added many new features to make PPRE as versatile as it is.
PPRE is written in Python and makes use of PyQt for its GUI. Development was led
by SCV and Alpha.

PPRE2 is a complete re-coring of PPRE. The original developers were still 
immature in their programming practices, so there is a lot of room to grow. The 
goal of PPRE2 is to provide a much better experience for ROM editing and to add 
many new features. Development is led by Alpha and open to the Project Pokemon 
community.

PPRE2 should be referred to as PPRE.
